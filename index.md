### CPSC 120

* Lab 4
    
    Lab 4, part 2 is one of my favorites because it was my first introduction to coding a game. I was able to play this game with my friends and show them what I learned in the lab. This project also helped me become comfortable with asking the user for input and incorporating bool.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 is another one of my favorite labs because it incorporates math principles and math is my favorite subject. For this lab I also was able to utilize the && operations which were tricky for me at first. This lab also helped me create concise code instead of using long and unnecessary source code. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a great lab because it incorporated one of my favorite foods- pizza, while also using a newer command called ‘ignore.’ This lab incorporated a different data type, a class instead of the primitive types. This lab was great practice for using vectors and adding elements using ‘push_back.’
